For every letter in an English word, you replace it with the letter in the chart.

Non-literal exceptions (i.e. Culture):

These are things like idioms, common sayings, and catch phrases. The translator supports the option for some of those.

How to use:

In exceptions.txt, type,

[intended meaning] : [non-literal/idiomatic translation]

So for example,

wait a minute : hold your horses
that's easy : piece of cake
good luck : break a leg
start over : back to the drawing board

How this works is that if you type "wait a minute" as a phrase you want to translate, the translator will
automatically change your text to "hold your horses", and translate that. 

Here are some more examples, specific to the culture of the made-up language:

peace be with you : may your stones be big
and also with you : I like big stones
I am the greatest : My stones are like boulders
What are you doing? : Where are your stones?
How are you? : How is your stone harvest?
