# Translator
A translator for a made-up language: Unga Bunga Tounga

The language is basically a cipher, but with some exceptions. These exceptions are idioms/non-literal
translations that add culture, and serve to legitimize the cipher as a language.

## Culture
A language cannot be separated from the culture of those who speak it. But, not many people speak this
language, so we have to inject the culture artificially by creating our own idioms and non-literal translations.
The culture of this language is primarily based around stones and Counter-Strike.
