Project is dead. Languages are hard to create, and time consuming. Might return to this later

# Translator V3
A translator for a made-up language: Unga Bunga Tounga

The root words for the language are made by putting English words through a basic cipher.
It just takes out all the work of thinking of approximately 2,000,000 different combinations of letters to make
words for a language. The plan is to implement a complete grammatical structure for the language that is unique
from English. The language will be topic-prominent and agglutinative. 

Right now, this is just the base of the language. All the translator does right now is it takes strings and puts them
through the cipher. It's a significant step back from V2 of the translator, but it has greatly simplified everything to
start off with. This is great, because implementing the grammatical structure is going to be significantly harder than
what I did before with V2. Plus, I still haven't fully finished the grammatical structure of the language. I still need
to think of some affixes and some pronunciation rules.
  
## Bugs
- None of the bugs from V2 made it into this version, because I completely rebuilt this from the ground up. But, with all that
  being said... 
- The GUI is still not resizable. You still have to deal with it being 640x400.
